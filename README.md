# Calories-prediction-using-Random-Forest
This project is a Regression one whose aim is to determine the calorie expended by different individuals from a set of variables.
Different machine learning techniques were applied in Loading of data, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Feature selection, Feature Engineering and Model Development.
The split dataset was passed through a RandomForestRegressor model for training and performance evaluation, this yielded a Mean Absolute error of 2.21, Mean Squared Error of 12.49 and an R2_score of 99.69%.
Though almost a perfect model, hyperparameter tuning was carried out on the model using GridSearchCV, this produced a performance score of 99.75% for the R2_score.
Dataset was sourced from Kaggle.com
